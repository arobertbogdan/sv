This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Token endpoint -> localhost:3000/auth/token with application/x-www-form-urlencoded -> email and password

Authorization:
	Header attribute -> Authorization: Token token=[auth_token]


Subscribe / Unsubscribe

	http://localhost:3000/category/[category_id]/subscribe
	Header attribute -> Authorization: Token token=[auth_token]

Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
